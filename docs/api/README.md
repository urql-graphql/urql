# API

`urql` is a collection of multiple packages. You'll likely be using one of the framework bindings
package or exchange packages, which are all listed in this section.

Most of these packages will refer to or use utilities and types from the `@urql/core` package. [Read
more about the core package on the "Core" page.](../basics/core.md)

> **Note:** These API docs are deprecated as we now keep TSDocs in all published packages.
> You can view TSDocs while using these packages in your editor, as long as it supports the
> TypeScript Language Server.
> We're planning to replace these API docs with a separate web app soon.
