# Retrying Operations

The `retryExchange` lets us retry specific operation, by default it will
retry only network errors, but we can specify additional options to add
functionality.

## Installation and Setup

First install `@urql/exchange-retry` alongside `urql`:

```sh
yarn add @urql/exchange-retry
# or
npm install --save @urql/exchange-retry
```

You'll then need to add the `retryExchange`, exposed by this package, to your `urql` Client:

```js
import { createClient, dedupExchange, cacheExchange, fetchExchange } from 'urql';
import { retryExchange } from '@urql/exchange-retry';

// None of these options have to be added, these are the default values.
const options = {
  initialDelayMs: 1000,
  maxDelayMs: 15000,
  randomDelay: true,
  maxNumberAttempts: 2,
  retryIf: err => err && err.networkError,
};

// Note the position of the retryExchange - it should be placed prior to the
// fetchExchange and after the cacheExchange for it to function correctly
const client = createClient({
  url: 'http://localhost:1234/graphql',
  exchanges: [
    dedupExchange,
    cacheExchange,
    retryExchange(options), // Use the retryExchange factory to add a new exchange
    fetchExchange,
  ],
});
```

We want to place the `retryExchange` before the `fetchExchange` so that retries are only performed _after_ the operation has passed through the cache and has attempted to fetch.

## The Options

There are a set of optional options that allow for fine-grained control over the `retry` mechanism.

We have the `initialDelayMs` to specify at what interval the `retrying` should start, this means that if we specify `1000` that when our `operation` fails we'll wait 1 second and then retry it.

Next up is the `maxDelayMs`, our `retryExchange` will keep increasing the time between retries, so we don't spam our server with requests it can't complete, this option ensures we don't exceed a certain threshold. This time between requests will increase with a random `back-off` factor multiplied by the `initialDelayMs`, read more about the [thundering herd problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thundering_herd_problem).

Talking about increasing the `delay` randomly, `randomDelay` allows us to disable this. When this option is set to `false` we'll only increase the time between attempts with the `initialDelayMs`. This means if we fail the first time we'll have 1 second wait, next fail we'll have 2 seconds and so on.

We don't want to infinitely attempt an `operation`, we can declare how many times it should attempt the `operation` with `maxNumberAttempts`.

[For more information on the available options check out the API Docs.](../api/retry-exchange.md)

## Reacting to Different Errors

We can introduce specific triggers for the `retryExchange` to start retrying operations,
let's look at an example:

```js
import { createClient, dedupExchange, cacheExchange, fetchExchange } from 'urql';
import { retryExchange } from '@urql/exchange-retry';

const client = createClient({
  url: 'http://localhost:1234/graphql',
  exchanges: [
    dedupExchange,
    cacheExchange,
    retryExchange({
      retryIf: error => {
        return !!(error.graphQLErrors.length > 0 ||Â error.networkError);
      },
    }),
    fetchExchange,
  ],
});
```

In the above example we'll retry when we have `graphQLErrors` or a `networkError`, we can go
more granular and check for certain errors in `graphQLErrors`.

## Failover / Fallback

In case of a network error, e.g., when part the infrastructure is down, but a fallback GraphQL endpoint is available, e.g., from a different provider on a different domain, the `retryWith` option allows for client-side failover. This could also be used in case of a `graphQLError`, for example, when APIs are deployed via a windowing strategy, i.e., a newer version at URL X, while an older one remains at Y.

Note that finer granularity depending on custom requirements may be applicable, and that this does not allow for balancing load.

```js
const fallbackUrl = 'http://localhost:1337/anotherGraphql';

const options = {
  initialDelayMs: 1000,
  maxDelayMs: 15000,
  randomDelay: true,
  maxNumberAttempts: 2,
  retryWith: (error, operation) => {
    if (error.networkError) {
      const context = { ...operation.context, url: fallbackUrl };
      return { ...operation, context };
    }
    return null;
  },
};
```
