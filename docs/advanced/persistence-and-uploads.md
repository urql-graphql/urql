# Persisted Queries and Uploads

`urql` supports both [Automatic Persisted
Queries](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/performance/apq/), Persisted Queries, and
[File Uploads](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/apollo-server/data/file-uploads/).

While File Uploads should work without any modifications, an additional exchange must be installed
and added for Persisted Queries to work.

## Automatic Persisted Queries

Persisted Queries allow us to send requests to the GraphQL API that can easily be cached on the fly,
both by the GraphQL API itself and potential CDN caching layers. This is based on the unofficial
[GraphQL Persisted Queries
Spec](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-link-persisted-queries#apollo-engine).

With Automatic Persisted Queries the client hashes the GraphQL query and turns it into an SHA256
hash and sends this hash instead of the full query. If the server has seen this GraphQL query before
it will recognise it by its hash and process the GraphQL API request as usual, otherwise it may
respond using a `PersistedQueryNotFound` error. In that case the client is supposed to instead send
the full GraphQL query, and the hash together, which will cause the query to be "registered" with the
server.

Additionally, we could also decide to send these hashed queries as GET requests instead of POST
requests. If we only send the persisted queries with hashes as GET requests then they become a lot
easier for a CDN to cache, as by default most caches would not cache POST requests automatically.

In `urql`, we may use the `@urql/exchange-persisted` package's `persistedExchange` to
implement Automatic Persisted Queries. This exchange works alongside the default `fetchExchange`
and other exchanges by adding the `extensions.persistedQuery` parameters to a GraphQL request.

### Installation & Setup

First install `@urql/exchange-persisted` alongside `urql`:

```sh
yarn add @urql/exchange-persisted
# or
npm install --save @urql/exchange-persisted
```

You'll then need to add the `persistedExchange` function, that this package exposes,
to your `exchanges`.

```js
import { createClient, dedupExchange, fetchExchange, cacheExchange } from 'urql';
import { persistedExchange } from '@urql/exchange-persisted-fetch';

const client = createClient({
  url: 'http://localhost:1234/graphql',
  exchanges: [
    dedupExchange,
    cacheExchange,
    persistedExchange({
      preferGetForPersistedQueries: true,
    }),
    fetchExchange,
  ],
});
```

As we can see, typically it's recommended to set `preferGetForPersistedQueries` to `true` to force
all persisted queries to use GET requests instead of POST so that CDNs can do their job.
We also added the `persistedExchange` in front of the usual `fetchExchange`, since it has to
update operations before they reach an exchange that talks to an API.

The `preferGetForPersistedQueries` is similar to the [`Client`'s
`preferGetMethod`](../api/core.md#client) but only switches persisted queries to use GET requests
instead. This is preferable since sometimes the GraphQL query can grow too large for a simple GET
query to handle, while the `persistedExchange`'s SHA256 hashes will remain predictably small.

### Customizing Hashing

The `persistedExchange` also accepts a `generateHash` option. This may be used to swap out the
exchange's default method of generating SHA256 hashes. By default, the exchange will use the
built-in [Web Crypto API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Crypto_API) when it's
available, and in Node.js it'll use the [Node Crypto Module](https://nodejs.org/api/crypto.html)
instead.

If you're using [the `graphql-persisted-document-loader` for
Webpack](https://github.com/leoasis/graphql-persisted-document-loader), for instance, then you will
already have a loader generating SHA256 hashes for you at compile time. In that case we could swap
out the `generateHash` function with a much simpler one that uses the `generateHash` function's
second argument, a GraphQL `DocumentNode` object.

```js
persistedFetchExchange({
  generateHash: (_, document) => document.documentId,
});
```

If you're using **React Native** then you may not have access to the Web Crypto API, which means
that you have to provide your own SHA256 function to the `persistedExchange`. Luckily, we can do
so easily by using the first argument `generateHash` receives, a GraphQL query as a string.

```js
import sha256 from 'hash.js/lib/hash/sha/256';

persistedFetchExchange({
  generateHash: async query => {
    return sha256().update(query).digest('hex');
  },
});
```

Additionally, if the API only expects persisted queries and not arbitrary ones and all queries are
pre-registered against the API then the `persistedExchange` may be put into a **non-automatic**
persisted queries mode by giving it the `enforcePersistedQueries: true` option. This disables any
retry logic and assumes that persisted queries will be handled like regular GraphQL requests.

## File Uploads

Many GraphQL server frameworks and APIs support the ["GraphQL Multipart Request
Spec](https://github.com/jaydenseric/graphql-multipart-request-spec) to allow files to be uploaded.
Often, this is defined in schemas using a `File` or `Upload` input.
This allows us to pass a `File` or `Blob` directly to our GraphQL requests as variables, and the
spec requires us to perform this request as a multipart upload.

Files are often handled in the browser via the [File API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File),
which we may typically get to via a [file input](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/File/Using_files_from_web_applications)
for example.

In `urql`, these are supported natively, so as long as your JS environment supports either `File` or
`Blob`s, you can pass these directly to any `urql` API via your `variables`, and the default
`fetchExchange` will swich to using a multipart request instead.

Previously, this worked by installing the [`@urql/multipart-fetch-exchange` package](../api/multipart-fetch-exchange.md),
however, this package has been deprecated and file uploads are now built into `@urql/core`.
