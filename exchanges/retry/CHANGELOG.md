# Changelog

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

  Submitted by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#3579](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3579))

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

---

Fixed the delay amount not increasing as retry count increases
Submitted by [@DoisKoh](https://github.com/DoisKoh) (See [#3478](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3478))

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Reset `retryExchange`’s previous attempts and delay if an operation succeeds. This prevents the exchange from keeping its old retry count and delay if the operation delivered a result in the meantime. This is important for it to help recover from failing subscriptions
  Submitted by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#3229](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3229))

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Publish with npm provenance
  Submitted by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#3180](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3180))

## 1.1.0

### Minor Changes

- Update exchanges to drop redundant `share` calls, since `@urql/core`’s `composeExchanges` utility now automatically does so for us
  Submitted by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#3082](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3082))

### Patch Changes

- Upgrade to `wonka@^6.3.0`
  Submitted by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#3104](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3104))
- Add TSDocs for all exchanges, documenting API internals
  Submitted by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#3072](https://github.com/urql-graphql/urql/pull/3072))

  - @urql/core@4.0.0

## 1.0.0

### Major Changes

- **Goodbye IE11!** 👋 This major release removes support for IE11. All code that is shipped will be transpiled much less and will _not_ be ES5-compatible anymore, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2504](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2504))
- Upgrade to [Wonka v6](https://github.com/0no-co/wonka) (`wonka@^6.0.0`), which has no breaking changes but is built to target ES2015 and comes with other minor improvements.
  The library has fully been migrated to TypeScript which will hopefully help with making contributions easier!, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2504](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2504))

### Patch Changes

- make `randomDelay` work correctly, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#2615](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2615))
- Updated dependencies (See [#2551](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2551), [#2504](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2504), [#2619](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2619), [#2607](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2607), and [#2504](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2504))
  - @urql/core@3.0.0

## 0.3.3

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies (See [#2384](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2384) and [#2386](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2386))
  - @urql/core@2.4.4

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- Extend peer dependency range of `graphql` to include `^16.0.0`.
  As always when upgrading across many packages of `urql`, especially including `@urql/core` we recommend you to deduplicate dependencies after upgrading, using `npm dedupe` or `npx yarn-deduplicate`, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2133](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2133))
- Updated dependencies (See [#2133](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2133))
  - @urql/core@2.3.6

## 0.3.1

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix operations sometimes not being executed after a retry is supposed to be triggered, due to a `setTimeout` reordering issue when the timer isn't as predictable as it should be, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2124](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2124))

## 0.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a new `retryWith` option which allows operations to be updated when a request is being retried, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1881](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1881))

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies (See [#1870](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1870) and [#1880](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1880))
  - @urql/core@2.3.1

## 0.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Remove closure-compiler from the build step (See [#1570](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1570))
- Updated dependencies (See [#1570](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1570), [#1509](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1509), [#1600](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1600), and [#1515](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1515))
  - @urql/core@2.1.0

## 0.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add a second `Operation` input argument to the `retryIf` predicate, so that retrying can be actively avoided for specific types of operations, e.g. mutations or subscriptions, in certain user-defined cases, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1117](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1117))

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies (See [#1119](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1119), [#1113](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1113), [#1104](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1104), and [#1123](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1123))
  - @urql/core@1.15.0

## 0.1.10

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix the production build overwriting the development build. Specifically in the previous release we mistakenly replaced all development bundles with production bundles. This doesn't have any direct influence on how these packages work, but prevented development warnings from being logged or full errors from being thrown, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1097](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1097))
- Updated dependencies (See [#1097](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1097))
  - @urql/core@1.14.1

## 0.1.9

### Patch Changes

- Deprecate the `Operation.operationName` property in favor of `Operation.kind`. This name was
  previously confusing as `operationName` was effectively referring to two different things. You can
  safely upgrade to this new version, however to mute all deprecation warnings you will have to
  **upgrade** all `urql` packages you use. If you have custom exchanges that spread operations, please
  use [the new `makeOperation` helper
  function](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/api/core/#makeoperation) instead, by [@bkonkle](https://github.com/bkonkle) (See [#1045](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1045))
- Updated dependencies (See [#1094](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1094) and [#1045](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1045))
  - @urql/core@1.14.0

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- Upgrade to a minimum version of wonka@^4.0.14 to work around issues with React Native's minification builds, which use uglify-es and could lead to broken bundles, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#842](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/842))
- Updated dependencies (See [#838](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/838) and [#842](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/842))
  - @urql/core@1.12.0

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- Add `source` debug name to all `dispatchDebug` calls during build time to identify events by which exchange dispatched them, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#780](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/780))
- Updated dependencies (See [#780](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/780))
  - @urql/core@1.11.7

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- Add a `"./package.json"` entry to the `package.json`'s `"exports"` field for Node 14. This seems to be required by packages like `rollup-plugin-svelte` to function properly, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#771](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/771))
- Updated dependencies (See [#771](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/771))
  - @urql/core@1.11.6

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Add debugging events to exchanges that add more detailed information on what is happening
  internally, which will be displayed by devtools like the urql [Chrome / Firefox extension](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-devtools), by [@andyrichardson](https://github.com/andyrichardson) (See [#608](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/608))
- Updated dependencies (See [#608](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/608), [#718](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/718), and [#722](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/722))
  - @urql/core@1.11.0

## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- Add graphql@^15.0.0 to peer dependency range, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#688](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/688))
- Updated dependencies (See [#688](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/688) and [#678](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/678))
  - @urql/core@1.10.8

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix node resolution when using Webpack, which experiences a bug where it only resolves
  `package.json:main` instead of `module` when an `.mjs` file imports a package, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#642](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/642))
- Updated dependencies (See [#642](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/642))
  - @urql/core@1.10.4

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix Node.js Module support for v13 (experimental-modules) and v14. If your bundler doesn't support
  `.mjs` files and fails to resolve the new version, please double check your configuration for
  Webpack, or similar tools, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#637](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/637))
- Updated dependencies (See [#637](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/637))
  - @urql/core@1.10.3

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix Rollup bundle output being written to .es.js instead of .esm.js, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#609](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/609))
- Updated dependencies (See [#609](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/609))
  - @urql/core@1.10.1

## v0.1.0
