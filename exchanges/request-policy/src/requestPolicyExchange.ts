 * The `requestPolicyExchange` upgrades query operations based on {@link Options.ttl}.
 * The `ttl` defines a timeframe outside of which a query's request policy is set to
 * `cache-and-network` to refetch it in the background.
 *
 * You may define a {@link Options.shouldUpgrade} function to selectively ignore some
 * operations by returning `false` there.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * requestPolicyExchange({
 *  // Upgrade when we haven't seen this operation for 1 second
 *  ttl: 1000,
 *  // and only upgrade operations that query the `todos` field.
 *  shouldUpgrade: op => op.kind === 'query' && op.query.definitions[0].name?.value === 'todos'
