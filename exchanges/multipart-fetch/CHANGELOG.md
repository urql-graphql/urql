- Updated dependencies (See [#947](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/947), [#962](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/962), and [#957](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/957))

## 0.1.8

### Patch Changes

- Upgrade to a minimum version of wonka@^4.0.14 to work around issues with React Native's minification builds, which use uglify-es and could lead to broken bundles, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#842](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/842))
- Updated dependencies (See [#838](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/838) and [#842](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/842))

## 0.1.7

### Patch Changes

- Add `source` debug name to all `dispatchDebug` calls during build time to identify events by which exchange dispatched them, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#780](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/780))
- Updated dependencies (See [#780](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/780))
  - @urql/core@1.11.7

## 0.1.6

### Patch Changes

- Add a `"./package.json"` entry to the `package.json`'s `"exports"` field for Node 14. This seems to be required by packages like `rollup-plugin-svelte` to function properly, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#771](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/771))
- Updated dependencies (See [#771](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/771))
  - @urql/core@1.11.6

## 0.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Add debugging events to exchanges that add more detailed information on what is happening
  internally, which will be displayed by devtools like the urql [Chrome / Firefox extension](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql-devtools), by [@andyrichardson](https://github.com/andyrichardson) (See [#608](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/608))
- Add @urql/core/internal entrypoint for internally shared utilities and start sharing fetchExchange-related code, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#722](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/722))
- Updated dependencies (See [#608](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/608), [#718](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/718), and [#722](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/722))

- ⚠️ Fix non-2xx results never being parsed as GraphQL results. This can result in valid GraphQLErrors being hidden, which should take precedence over generic HTTP NetworkErrors, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#678](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/678))
- Updated dependencies (See [#688](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/688) and [#678](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/678))
  - @urql/core@1.10.8

## 0.1.3

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix node resolution when using Webpack, which experiences a bug where it only resolves
  `package.json:main` instead of `module` when an `.mjs` file imports a package, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#642](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/642))
- Updated dependencies (See [#642](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/642))
  - @urql/core@1.10.4

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix multipart conversion, in the `extract-files` dependency (used by multipart-fetch) there is an explicit check for the constructor property of an object. This made the files unretrievable, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#639](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/639))
- ⚠️ Fix Node.js Module support for v13 (experimental-modules) and v14. If your bundler doesn't support
  `.mjs` files and fails to resolve the new version, please double check your configuration for
  Webpack, or similar tools, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#637](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/637))
- Updated dependencies (See [#637](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/637))
  - @urql/core@1.10.3
