## ✨ Features

- 📦 **One package** to get a working GraphQL client in React, Preact, and Svelte
- ⚙️ Fully **customisable** behaviour [via "exchanges"](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/concepts/exchanges)
- 🗂 Logical but simple default behaviour and document caching
- 🌱 Normalized caching via [`@urql/exchange-graphcache`](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/graphcache)

`urql` is a GraphQL client that exposes a set of helpers for several frameworks. It's built to be highly customisable and versatile so you can take it from getting started with your first GraphQL project all the way to building complex apps and experimenting with GraphQL clients.

While GraphQL is an elegant protocol and schema language, client libraries today typically come with large API footprints. We aim to create something more lightweight instead.

## Installation

```sh
yarn add urql graphql
# or
npm install --save urql graphql
```
