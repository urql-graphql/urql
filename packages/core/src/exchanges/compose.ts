 * @remarks
 * `composeExchanges` returns an {@link Exchange} that when instantiated
 * composes the array of passed `Exchange`s into one, calling them from
 * right to left, with the prior `Exchange`â€™s {@link ExchangeIO} function
 * as the {@link ExchangeInput.forward} input.
 *
 * This simply merges all exchanges into one and is used by the {@link Client}
 * to merge the `exchanges` option it receives.
