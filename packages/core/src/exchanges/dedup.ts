/** Default deduplication exchange.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `dedupExchange` deduplicates queries and subscriptions that are
 * started with identical documents and variables by deduplicating by
 * their {@link Operation.key}.
 * This can prevent duplicate requests from being sent to your GraphQL API.
 *
 * Because this is a very safe exchange to add to any GraphQL setup, itâ€™s
 * not only the default, but we also recommend you to always keep this
 * exchange added and included in your setup.
 *
 * Hint: In React and Vue, some common usage patterns can trigger duplicate
 * operations. For instance, in React a single render will actually
 * trigger two phases that execute an {@link Operation}.
