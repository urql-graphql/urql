/** Simple log debugger exchange.
 *
 * @remarks
 * An exchange that logs incoming {@link Operation | Operations} and
 * {@link OperationResult | OperationResults} in development.
 *
 * This exchange is a no-op in production and often used in issue reporting
 * to understand certain usage patterns of `urql` without having access to
 * the original source code.
 *
 * Hint: When you report an issue youâ€™re having with `urql`, adding
 * this as your first exchange and posting its output can speed up
 * issue triaging a lot!
