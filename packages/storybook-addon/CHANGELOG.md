# @urql/storybook-addon

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- remove dependency on `react-urql` from storybook exchange, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#2646](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2646))

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- **Goodbye IE11!** üëã This major release removes support for IE11. All code that is shipped will be transpiled much less and will _not_ be ES5-compatible anymore, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2504](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2504))
- Upgrade to [Wonka v6](https://github.com/0no-co/wonka) (`wonka@^6.0.0`), which has no breaking changes but is built to target ES2015 and comes with other minor improvements.
  The library has fully been migrated to TypeScript which will hopefully help with making contributions easier!, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2504](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2504))

## 1.0.9

### Patch Changes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix Node.js ESM re-export detection for `@urql/core` in `urql` package and CommonJS output for all other CommonJS-first packages. This ensures that Node.js' `cjs-module-lexer` can correctly identify re-exports and report them properly. Otherwise, this will lead to a runtime error, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2485](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2485))

## 1.0.8

### Patch Changes

- Extend peer dependency range of `graphql` to include `^16.0.0`.
  As always when upgrading across many packages of `urql`, especially including `@urql/core` we recommend you to deduplicate dependencies after upgrading, using `npm dedupe` or `npx yarn-deduplicate`, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2133](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2133))

## 1.0.7

### Patch Changes

- Remove closure-compiler from the build step (See [#1570](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1570))

## 1.0.6

### Patch Changes

- Add Storybook metadata to `package.json` for npm discoverability, by [@coderkevin](https://github.com/coderkevin) (See [#1469](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1469))

## 1.0.5

### Patch Changes

- Add missing optional dependency (@urql/devtools), by [@andyrichardson](https://github.com/andyrichardson) (See [#1129](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1129))

## 1.0.4

### Patch Changes

- - Add `@urql/devtools` to `@urql/storybook-addon`. Previously it was not included (See [#1092](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/issues/1092)), but now the exchange works out of the box with Storybook, by [@r281GQ](https://github.com/r281GQ) (See [#1112](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1112))

## 1.0.3
