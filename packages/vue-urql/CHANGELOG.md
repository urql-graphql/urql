# @urql/preact

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Update `@urql/preact` implementation to match `urql` React implementation. Internally these changes should align behaviour and updates slightly, but outwardly no changes should be apparent apart from how some updates are scheduled, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1008](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1008))

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies (See [#1011](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1011))
  - @urql/core@1.13.1

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Handle a bug in Preact where the current request might be `null`, by [@jlengstorf](https://github.com/jlengstorf) (See [#944](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/944))
- Updated dependencies (See [#947](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/947), [#962](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/962), and [#957](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/957))
  - @urql/core@1.13.0

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies (See [#911](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/911) and [#908](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/908))
  - @urql/core@1.12.3

## 1.1.8

### Patch Changes

- Upgrade to a minimum version of wonka@^4.0.14 to work around issues with React Native's minification builds, which use uglify-es and could lead to broken bundles, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#842](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/842))
- Updated dependencies (See [#838](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/838) and [#842](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/842))
  - @urql/core@1.12.0

## 1.1.7

### Patch Changes

- Add a `"./package.json"` entry to the `package.json`'s `"exports"` field for Node 14. This seems to be required by packages like `rollup-plugin-svelte` to function properly, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#771](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/771))
- Updated dependencies (See [#771](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/771))
  - @urql/core@1.11.6

## 1.1.6

### Patch Changes

- Bump @urql/core to ensure exchanges have dispatchDebug, this could formerly result in a crash, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#726](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/726))

## 1.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Add graphql@^15.0.0 to peer dependency range, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#688](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/688))
- Forcefully bump @urql/core package in all bindings and in @urql/exchange-graphcache.
  We're aware that in some cases users may not have upgraded to @urql/core, even though that's within
  the typical patch range. Since the latest @urql/core version contains a patch that is required for
  `cache-and-network` to work, we're pushing another patch that now forcefully bumps everyone to the
  new version that includes this fix, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#684](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/684))
- Updated dependencies (See [#688](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/688) and [#678](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/678))
  - @urql/core@1.10.8

## 1.1.4

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix node resolution when using Webpack, which experiences a bug where it only resolves
  `package.json:main` instead of `module` when an `.mjs` file imports a package, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#642](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/642))
- Updated dependencies (See [#642](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/642))
  - @urql/core@1.10.4

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- ⚠️ Fix Node.js Module support for v13 (experimental-modules) and v14. If your bundler doesn't support
  `.mjs` files and fails to resolve the new version, please double check your configuration for
  Webpack, or similar tools, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#637](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/637))
- Updated dependencies (See [#637](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/637))
  - @urql/core@1.10.3

- Updated dependencies (See [#621](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/621))
  - @urql/core@1.10.2
