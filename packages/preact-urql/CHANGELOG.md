# @urql/preact

## 3.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Update generics for components, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#2663](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2663))
- Updated dependencies (See [#2665](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2665))
  - @urql/core@3.0.3

## 3.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Tweak the variables type for when generics only contain nullable keys, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#2623](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2623))

## 3.0.0

### Major Changes

- **Goodbye IE11!** üëã This major release removes support for IE11. All code that is shipped will be transpiled much less and will _not_ be ES5-compatible anymore, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2504](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2504))
- Implement stricter variables types, which require variables to always be passed and match TypeScript types when the generic is set or inferred. This is a breaking change for TypeScript users potentially, unless all types are adhered to, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2607](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2607))
- Upgrade to [Wonka v6](https://github.com/0no-co/wonka) (`wonka@^6.0.0`), which has no breaking changes but is built to target ES2015 and comes with other minor improvements.
  The library has fully been migrated to TypeScript which will hopefully help with making contributions easier!, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2504](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2504))

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies (See [#2551](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2551), [#2504](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2504), [#2619](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2619), [#2607](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2607), and [#2504](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2504))
  - @urql/core@3.0.0

## 2.0.4

### Patch Changes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix Node.js ESM re-export detection for `@urql/core` in `urql` package and CommonJS output for all other CommonJS-first packages. This ensures that Node.js' `cjs-module-lexer` can correctly identify re-exports and report them properly. Otherwise, this will lead to a runtime error, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2485](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2485))

## 2.0.3

### Patch Changes

- Extend peer dependency range of `graphql` to include `^16.0.0`.
  As always when upgrading across many packages of `urql`, especially including `@urql/core` we recommend you to deduplicate dependencies after upgrading, using `npm dedupe` or `npx yarn-deduplicate`, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#2133](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2133))
- Updated dependencies (See [#2133](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/2133))
  - @urql/core@2.3.6

## 2.0.2

### Patch Changes

- Remove closure-compiler from the build step (See [#1570](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1570))
- Updated dependencies (See [#1570](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1570), [#1509](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1509), [#1600](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1600), and [#1515](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1515))
  - @urql/core@2.1.0

## 2.0.1

### Patch Changes

- Add a displayName to the Provider, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#1431](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1431))

## 2.0.0

### Major Changes

- **Breaking**: Remove `pollInterval` option from `useQuery`. Instead please consider using `useEffect` calling `executeQuery` on an interval, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1374](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1374))

### Minor Changes

- Remove deprecated `operationName` property from `Operation`s. The new `Operation.kind` property is now preferred. If you're creating new operations you may also use the `makeOperation` utility instead.
  When upgrading `@urql/core` please ensure that your package manager didn't install any duplicates of it. You may deduplicate it manually using `npx yarn-deduplicate` (for Yarn) or `npm dedupe` (for npm), by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1357](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1357))

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies (See [#1374](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1374), [#1357](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1357), and [#1375](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1375))
  - @urql/core@2.0.0

## 1.4.4

### Patch Changes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix Suspense when results share data, this would return partial results for graphCache and not update to the eventual data, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#1282](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1282))

## 1.4.3

### Patch Changes

- Add a built-in `gql` tag function helper to `@urql/core`. This behaves similarly to `graphql-tag` but only warns about _locally_ duplicated fragment names rather than globally. It also primes `@urql/core`'s key cache with the parsed `DocumentNode`, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1187](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1187))
- Add `suspense: false` to options when `executeQuery` is called explicitly, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1181](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1181))
- Updated dependencies (See [#1187](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1187), [#1186](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1186), and [#1186](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1186))
  - @urql/core@1.16.0

## 1.4.2

### Patch Changes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix regression in client-side Suspense behaviour. This has been fixed in `urql@1.11.0` and `@urql/preact@1.4.0` but regressed in the patches afterwards that were aimed at fixing server-side Suspense, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1142](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1142))

## 1.4.1

### Patch Changes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix server-side rendering by disabling the new Suspense cache on the server-side and clear it for prepasses, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#1138](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1138))
- Updated dependencies (See [#1135](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1135))
  - @urql/core@1.15.1

## 1.4.0

### Minor Changes

- Improve the Suspense implementation, which fixes edge-cases when Suspense is used with subscriptions, partially disabled, or _used on the client-side_. It has now been ensured that client-side suspense functions without the deprecated `suspenseExchange` and uncached results are loaded consistently. As part of this work, the `Client` itself does now never throw Suspense promises anymore, which is functionality that either way has no place outside of the React/Preact bindings, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1123](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1123))

### Patch Changes

- Add support for `TypedDocumentNode` to infer the type of the `OperationResult` and `Operation` for all methods, functions, and hooks that either directly or indirectly accept a `DocumentNode`. See [`graphql-typed-document-node` and the corresponding blog post for more information.](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-typed-document-node), by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1113](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1113))
- Refactor `useSource` hooks which powers `useQuery` and `useSubscription` to improve various edge case behaviour. This will not change the behaviour of these hooks dramatically but avoid unnecessary state updates when any updates are obviously equivalent and the hook will furthermore improve continuation from mount to effects, which will fix cases where the state between the mounting and effect phase may slightly change, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1104](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1104))
- Updated dependencies (See [#1119](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1119), [#1113](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1113), [#1104](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1104), and [#1123](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1123))
  - @urql/core@1.15.0

## 1.3.2

### Patch Changes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix the production build overwriting the development build. Specifically in the previous release we mistakenly replaced all development bundles with production bundles. This doesn't have any direct influence on how these packages work, but prevented development warnings from being logged or full errors from being thrown, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1097](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1097))
- Updated dependencies (See [#1097](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1097))
  - @urql/core@1.14.1

## 1.3.1

### Patch Changes

- Add missing `.mjs` extension to all imports from `graphql` to fix Webpack 5 builds, which require extension-specific import paths for ESM bundles and packages. **This change allows you to safely upgrade to Webpack 5.**, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1094](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1094))
- Updated dependencies (See [#1094](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1094) and [#1045](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1045))
  - @urql/core@1.14.0

## 1.3.0

### Minor Changes

- Update `@urql/preact` implementation to match `urql` React implementation. Internally these changes should align behaviour and updates slightly, but outwardly no changes should be apparent apart from how some updates are scheduled, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#1008](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1008))

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies (See [#1011](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/1011))
  - @urql/core@1.13.1

## 1.2.1

### Patch Changes

- Handle a bug in Preact where the current request might be `null`, by [@jlengstorf](https://github.com/jlengstorf) (See [#944](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/944))
- Updated dependencies (See [#947](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/947), [#962](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/962), and [#957](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/957))
  - @urql/core@1.13.0

## 1.2.0

### Minor Changes

- Add the operation to the query, mutation and subscription result, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#924](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/924))

### Patch Changes

- Updated dependencies (See [#911](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/911) and [#908](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/908))
  - @urql/core@1.12.3

## 1.1.8

### Patch Changes

- Upgrade to a minimum version of wonka@^4.0.14 to work around issues with React Native's minification builds, which use uglify-es and could lead to broken bundles, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#842](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/842))
- Updated dependencies (See [#838](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/838) and [#842](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/842))
  - @urql/core@1.12.0

## 1.1.7

### Patch Changes

- Add a `"./package.json"` entry to the `package.json`'s `"exports"` field for Node 14. This seems to be required by packages like `rollup-plugin-svelte` to function properly, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#771](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/771))
- Updated dependencies (See [#771](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/771))
  - @urql/core@1.11.6

## 1.1.6

### Patch Changes

- Bump @urql/core to ensure exchanges have dispatchDebug, this could formerly result in a crash, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#726](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/726))

## 1.1.5

### Patch Changes

- Add graphql@^15.0.0 to peer dependency range, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#688](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/688))
- Forcefully bump @urql/core package in all bindings and in @urql/exchange-graphcache.
  We're aware that in some cases users may not have upgraded to @urql/core, even though that's within
  the typical patch range. Since the latest @urql/core version contains a patch that is required for
  `cache-and-network` to work, we're pushing another patch that now forcefully bumps everyone to the
  new version that includes this fix, by [@kitten](https://github.com/kitten) (See [#684](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/684))
- Updated dependencies (See [#688](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/688) and [#678](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/678))
  - @urql/core@1.10.8

## 1.1.4

### Patch Changes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix node resolution when using Webpack, which experiences a bug where it only resolves
  `package.json:main` instead of `module` when an `.mjs` file imports a package, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#642](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/642))
- Updated dependencies (See [#642](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/642))
  - @urql/core@1.10.4

## 1.1.3

### Patch Changes

- ‚ö†Ô∏è Fix Node.js Module support for v13 (experimental-modules) and v14. If your bundler doesn't support
  `.mjs` files and fails to resolve the new version, please double check your configuration for
  Webpack, or similar tools, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#637](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/637))
- Updated dependencies (See [#637](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/637))
  - @urql/core@1.10.3

## 1.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Bumps the `@urql/core` dependency minor version to ^1.10.1 for React, Preact and Svelte, by [@JoviDeCroock](https://github.com/JoviDeCroock) (See [#623](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/623))
- Updated dependencies (See [#621](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/621))
  - @urql/core@1.10.2

## 1.1.1

### Patch Changes

- Switch over to using @urql/core package (See [`75323c0`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/commit/75323c0))
- Updated dependencies (See [#533](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/533), [#519](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/519), [#515](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/515), [#512](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/512), and [#518](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/urql/pull/518))
  - @urql/core@1.9.0

## 1.1.0

- Update urql to 1.8.0
- Update wonka to 4.0.0 (and incorporate breaking changes)
