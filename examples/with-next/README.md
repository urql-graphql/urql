This example shows `next-urql` and `urql` in use with Next.js as explained [in the "Next.js" section
on the "Server-side Rendering" docs
page](https://formidable.com/open-source/urql/docs/advanced/server-side-rendering/#nextjs).

To run this example install dependencies and run the `start` script:

```sh
yarn install
yarn run start
# or
npm install
npm run start
```

## getInitialProps

This is the output you'll get when you're using `{ ssr: true }`, this way urql will try to automate
as much for you as it possibly can by using a [`prepass`](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/react-ssr-prepass)
this means that every `useQuery` used in your virtual-dom will be ran, the data will be collected on the server
and hydrated on the client.

> NOTE: to reduce performance complexities try to keep this to top-level renders as this can amount to waterfalls.

## getStaticProps

This requires some manual work, when we look at [`static.js`](./pages/static.js) we can see that we define our own
`getStaticProps` method, this because these methods are only `user-facing`. When doing a `yarn next build` we'll need to
ensure that the server we're targetting is running so we can successfully execute the static prerender.

## getServerSideProps

This requires some manual work, when we look at [`server.js`](./pages/server.js) we can see that we define our own
`getServerSideProps` method, this because these methods are only `user-facing`.

## Output

We can see that our `/` and `/server` routes are rendered on the server and `/static` is statically prerendered.
